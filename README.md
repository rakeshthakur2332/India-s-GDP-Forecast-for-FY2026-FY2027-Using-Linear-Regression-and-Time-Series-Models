# India's GDP Forecast for FY2026-FY2027 Using Linear Regression and Time Series Models
India’s GDP forecast for FY2026–FY2027 using Linear Regression and ARIMA time-series models. Historical GDP data is cleaned, modeled, and visualized in Python to compare deterministic trend vs. stochastic forecasts. Includes dataset, reproducible notebook, and charts for academic, research, and baseline macro analysis.
